-> If you use VS CODE as the c++ compiler, it will compile the main.cpp to main.exe, which is the actual application you need to open <-

-> First of choose the password length(<=INT_MAX) <-

-> Second choose what characters the password should consist of(lower/upper case letters, numbers, special characters) -<

-> Choose if the passwords should be displayed in the console, or in a txt file. Choosing 'n' or 'N' to "Export to file?" will display the passwords in the console, which you can copy. The txt file will be saved in the same folder as the source code file <-

-> Lastly choose how many passwords to generate <-

-> The programm is reusable, meaning you don't have to close and open the application a million times if you want to reuse it. Choose the password settings and after the generations, press any key and the application will start as new, with a console clear screen. After each generations, the settings will be reset <-
